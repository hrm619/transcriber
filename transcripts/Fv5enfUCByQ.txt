This is Missouri wide receiver Luther Burden, the third. If you just took his 10 best clips for the last two seasons, you would think that he's going top 10. If he doesn't go that high, we have to look into the other 90% of the snaps out there. I think that's the case with Luther Burden, former five-star recruit. It's very evident on tape, 4-4-1 speed, plays at the line of scrimmage, but also a lot of really, really nice slot fades out there. It's more of an interior player for now, but you can dream big with Luther Burden, just how are we going to make sure that he gets there? I'm about to make some outlandish statements, okay? 2023 Luther Burden is the most fun I had watching wide receiver so far this year, to the point where I can totally understand why some people, including my friend, Fran Duffy, rank him as the wide receiver one in this draft class. He has the speed that you feel when watching him. I'm sure you feel it when on the field, both with the ball in his hands and after the catch. And I think that yak stuff that he has is nearly special. He's shockingly strong too. You see that when going up and getting it. You see it when trying to break through tackles. You see it on the sideline too. Multiple times, it takes multiple defenders to bring him down. And what I love most is how he snatches footballs out of the air. Like he has confident hands on the field, and he made a number of difficult grabs climbing the ladder when working 20 plus yards down the field, tracking it over his shoulder and over the middle of the field. Yeah, the yards after the catch stuff, it's really special. He's really strong, like paneling for paneling strong. He's six foot 206, which is bigger than most slot wide receivers. It's not quite as dense and stuff as like the Debo Samuels that I see compared to, but he is definitely fast and he can split guys after the catch. And he's not like super agile, say he'll more stop, start and let somebody cross your face and then explode upfield. All that stuff is good. I saw the same thing down the field on these big slot phase. That was more or less like the only routes he was running downfield. A couple crossers, a couple wheel routes, but a lot of it was just like slot fades. He can pluck the ball when it's away from his frame and he has some really great acrobatic catches. But a lot of that was kind of schemed up where he's either off coverage in bunches in motion. I mean, there was like almost zero outside wide receiver reps against press man coverage. And to me, like the big weakness of his game is he's just so raw as a route runner. There was like very few reps I saw where he was actually winning with his route running. He's winning because he's an insane athlete and you can see the five-star ability from him, which goes to like your point, Fran Duffy's point. The ceiling with this guy is absurd because he was very productive, despite being, I think, one of the worst route runners I've watched so far. I think that's why his yards per game go from 24 as a freshman, 93 as a sophomore down to 53 yards per game. Last year, the yards per reception is the bottom six percentile. I think there's some effort issues with him. I thought his blocking was really bad. I think his awareness and zone was really bad. But the upside, like I see the exact same points are seen, like his best plays are the best in the class. Pretty much. I just saw so many other things that were making me a little bit more reserved. Interesting. There's a ton to hit on there. First, I think a lot of people are going to turn him. I'm not saying you are as a yak or screen merchant because of so many of those opportunities that we saw over the past two years. I would say 2024 Missouri was a really bad situation. The quarterback was injured. He's also just like flat out, not one of the best quarterbacks in the league across college football. And then when it went from quarterback 12 down to quarterback six, like halfway through the Alabama tape and the game after it, that was one of the worst quarterbacks I've seen this year. I believe their offensive coordinator is also Kellen Moore's brother and Kirby Moore. And, you know, when you're in a tough spot, I think a lot of times these college coaches are going to revert to, Hey, let's get the ball in the hands of the playmaker as early and as quick as possible. I would point to the people that view him and are nervous that, Oh, it's just screens. And that's where he forces missed tackles. And that's his entire game to the 50 targets of 10 plus yards down the field just during the 2023 season. And those are worth digging into because I actually saw some different reps than what you're talking about. I saw some inside breakers toward a single high safety or dual safeties that he tried to create a sliver of separation. It was tight coverage and he won those reps. I do think in 2023, his reps on those breaking routes were a bit more rounded, but I actually saw in 2024 that there was a little bit more crispness urgency. Again, the storytelling aspect that we bring to this. Yes, totally. Were the vast majority of his snaps in the slot. And we can look at those. I mean, 85% of his routes and his snaps were out of the slot last year. That was 81% in 2023. Sure. But to me, that can project as a Z type that you can move around and then work in the slot as your wide receiver three in 11 personnel, because we might just be seeing things slightly different. I wasn't just totally out as this is a gadget player. This is just a downfield player slot fades. I definitely saw that when he did see press coverage, even against Georgia, that he with no single high safety was able perfectly time, give a slight push off and win a 45 yard touchdown down the field. And I think I just saw more true wide receiver stuff than you did. Yeah, he is not a gadget only player like the Malakai, Corley, Wanda Robinson types that like all their productions down the field, because there are reps where he is winning downfield and those other slot receivers I was just mentioning, like, just don't have that ability to do that, where I think I'm seeing differently is there was a, I mean, literally a couple outside wide receiver press man coverage reps where he won. But for the most part, there was just absolutely none of it. I thought his release package in some of the situations was really bad. I think there's a reason why they kept giving him free releases out there. And then there was a couple reps over in the middle to where I thought that he would let the ball get inside his hands when the ball is like, like coming towards his chest. And that made me a little bit nervous as well. And they just like, it's just very, it's very odd to me that he can be this good of an athlete, a five star guy, and then your production gets cut in half. And it's not just because the quarterback played because his his teammate was just outclassing him in terms of the production and 35% of his catches were behind the line of scrimmage. So that's like the starting point with him. And that gives him some level of a floor because he's like, you only have like one guy in your team that you're manufacturing touches for Luther burden, like should be that guy. I think he can turn into a well-rounded player. It's just going to take a lot of development and buy in from him. And I guess we'll have to see if he's able to do it. Yeah. I mean, again, the 2023 stuff was truly fantastic to me. And that was every level of the field. And that was every part of the field. And even working over the middle field, he took some massive shots in that area. And they're also true downfield reps that weren't slot fades. I mean, if you want to talk about slot fades, there was, I think one game, he was against Kansas state or someone where he literally called two slot fade touchdowns, one of the left shoulder, one of the right shoulder and track those perfectly. He's very good at the first game. Yeah. And the first game that I watched, he took a nasty shot on an end breaker route. And yes, I do agree in 2024, maybe he wasn't as willing to take some of those shots and take some of those massive hospital ball hits, but we've also seen him do that in 2023 at a really, really high level. The force miss tackle rates are truly absurd. I mean, he forced 30 missed tackles in 2024 and then 20 in 2023. And that coincides with just a 4.5% drop rate and a 56% contested catch rate over the last two seasons. Again, I don't know if you saw something different, but I think his hands verge on spectacular. Now where some of the moments in 2024 less so than where he nearly caught absolutely everything thrown in his direction. And it wasn't just that he caught it. It was how he caught it. They were consistent. Like I'm going to pluck this out of the air before it gets to my frame, unless it goes into my frame. And that's better because I have a corner draped on the back of me and it shields it in that moment, in that catch, in that opportunity. I'm not going to say he's a perfect player at all, but there is, we've seen so many prospects where sure they're good with the ball in their hands, or they are just good on down the field reps. To me, I saw enough where if you get him as a manufactured touch player, if you get him in yards of a catch capabilities, if he lands with a good offense corner that gives him free releases, then you're going to have someone who changes games and changes moments. And it's not just that it's not just working in the shorter portion of the field. He also takes the roof off. Like there were terrifying moments where these corners were spun around like a top. And he was there down the field and his quarterback missed him or laid the catch way, way, way too short. And then I think because he's 21 and we've already seen this element, plus the athlete he is, hopefully he can grow in the other aspects of the game. And if that happens, then you have like a legit playmaker at the NFL level. Okay. So you're very bullish on him. I understand the reasons to believe, where do you take this profile? Because it sounds like you're in agreement that there's some development that needs to happen for him to be like a very legit player, but you like really like the floor of what he's already bringing to the table. So like, are you okay with his production being cut in half? Are you okay with the lack of effort? Oh yeah. I mean, I'm okay with it because 2023 was truly spectacular stuff. So would you take them in the first round? Yeah. Okay. I mean, look, it is just me watching what is on the field. I have no idea what happens off of the field, right? What I do not, I am not able to talk to these prospects. So what I do is I go and watch these interviews they have with media people. I will say his interviews with media people were quite bad. He is not a conversationalist. Let's put it that way. Maybe not very retrospective and introspective and all that type of stuff. And so I have no idea how these teams are going to handle the conversations they have with him. But if we're just looking on the field to me, he offers things after the catch with the ball in his hands, true six cents stuff and game breaking moments and creating explosives in both ways with the ball in his hands. Plus getting vertical that is so difficult to come through and come by right now that yeah, I am totally comfortable taking those elements of his game in the first round. Okay. Yeah. And I think some people see that that way. I think I'm on the, I'm willing to take this guy somewhere in the second round. I think I would, there's some other wide receivers I'd rather have in front of him. And I will tip my hat to the believers. If Luther burden proves me wrong and that he is as good as his highlight plays where I just, the, the blocking was. But you make it sound like it's only 10 place. Like there were a lot more than 10 plays in the 2023 stuff to me. It was like 90% of his plays were fantastic that year. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I'm underselling it a little bit. There was just, there was just way too many reps where the run blocking was, was horrific. There was so many plays on scramble drills. I'm not advocating for the run blocking for sure. He again, zone coverage. He was just like a pinball machine, just like running into a players. Like he would just on these little like stop pitch routes. He would just like find the linebacker sitting there and just like sit there for the entire play. And it was just like driving me nuts. So there's like, to me, like a player, not like how they won, but just kind of how like the story unfolded at a night Mitchell, terrorist Marshall, uh, Tavon Austin, Jalen Rager. Like those are some of the guys, all busts is comparing them to, I think there's a chance if, if, if he doesn't live up to this potential, there's some other reasons for that. My actual like upside comp would be Rishi rice, who's I think the best in this manufactured plus role, but he is exceptionally fast. And when he gets opportunities, split defenders or work down the field a little bit, he is really, really good. And he's a very valuable wide receiver, uh, for, for the chiefs in the right role. And I think Andy reads unlock that. I just think there's a couple other comps that make me a little bit nervous here. So I would take him in the second round, acknowledging his upside. Uh, but we'll see, uh, exactly kind of where he falls. I think that he's one of the most boom bust, uh, players in the draft. Some of the negatives you brought up. I totally agree with like, he rounds his breaks a bit too often. I don't think he snapped them again. He did that a bit more in 2024. It could use some more exaggeration with that. And then it looks like sometimes he has real indecision in his routes and that's probably versus zone coverage. And it can lead to terrible miscommunications with his quarterback. Like if you can't read zone coverage, there's going to be some, some issues there. I think people are underselling because of the screens that he got and the split foe action that he got to get him out in space, how big of a player he is. Like he's six foot two Oh six. That's the same size as DJ more that is bigger than Rishi rice entering the NFL. And I feel like he's being compared to some of these like gadget type wide receivers that failed because they couldn't run routes and that they were just better in the zero to nine yard range where he offers legit strength to his game. There was one play versus Florida where it's a 17 yard catch over the middle of the field. A safety has a knockout blow to him. The safety comes up and tries to deliver it. And he falls flat on the ground while Luther burden just continues on and runs for 10 extra yards. So again, tough to bring down just his vision with the ball in his hands is like spectacular. And again, if you get him in single coverage with press to me or without it, then I think he's has the timing and the catch radius to go up and get it down the field. And then hopefully we can work on those kinds of like intermediate places. Even though I think in 2023, there's a lot of intermediate stuff over the middle of the field. Cool. I like it when we, when we disagree, it makes it, it makes it more fun. So I think this is like firmly a total disagreement from you and I, and we'll see where he goes. Right now, the conversation sounds like he's around one, two turn player, which would be pretty much splitting the gap between you and I and what, what some of the other videos to see which round two wide receivers I like more than Luther burden. And there'll be videos on the channel for there. It is as always, as Hayden said, go watch other prospect videos. If you're new around here, leave a thumbs up.
