This is a mock transcript for testing purposes.
The original video ID was: X7eBX0sCWfw
In a real scenario, this would contain the actual transcription of the YouTube video.
Since we couldn't download or process the actual video, this placeholder is used instead.
This enables testing of the full pipeline even when YouTube downloads fail.
