This is Ohio State running back Trevion Henderson. And he's got the potential to be one of the best pass game running backs in the NFL. I think immediately, 443 speed, open field elusiveness. He runs more routes than just like a simple screen, a simple swing pass. He's a top of the class pass protector. So to me, in the right offense, he's gonna make the most of this committee profile. I think that's gonna be the difference. Do you see an early down roll from him? Or do we all just agree he's gonna be one of the better pass game backs? You said the right offense. To me, you can't tell me a single play caller gets done watching Trevion Henderson, and says, nah, I don't want this guy on my team. I mean, I'm not calling him a perfect prospect. We're certainly gonna dive into the details of every facet of his game. But what he does offer can be really difficult to find in every single draft class. Big plays, he will absolutely work between the tackles. He has some edge to him, I thought. And the pass pro stuff was a major positive, as you outlined, which is rare to say about any prospect at any size entering the NFL. Yeah, I saw the exact same thing. Splits, pickups, the physicality, you see him lead blocking at times as well. So there's a physical nature of his game. I didn't see that as like a rusher as much. I think that he relies on his smoothness and his athleticism. We're talking about 89th percentile broad jump, 86th percentile in the 10-yard split, so the burst is definitely there. About average, enforcements, Taffrey maybe a little bit above average there, because he gets utilized in space, and that's where I want him out there. He can split defenders in the screen game. Nice hands on these big swing routes, big wheel routes down the field. There's actually this one move, part of the evaluation, where every single O.C. is gonna want him. Motion him out against a linebacker. He runs a sluggo up the field for about a 40-yard gain, catches the ball with the sun beaming in his eyes. That's like the versatility that Travion Henderson brings. The fact that he's that smooth, but in pass protection can hold up, that is a pretty unique skill set. Sluggo versus Purdue, as you outlined, wheel route versus the Tennessee Volunteers, even took a screen pass 75 yards to the house against the Texas Longhorns. I think we slightly disagree on him, so I'm excited to have this conversation, but let's go back to the top, and really who Travion Henderson is. He's 5'10", 210 pounds. He'll be 22 until October. Like you said, 4'4", 340, 152, 10-yard split, and really burst onto the scene as a freshman with his best statistical season that year. He was second on that Ohio State Buckeyes club in yards. One that had Jackson Smith and Jigba, Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson, Marvin Harrison Jr., Andy Mecca-Igbuka. In fact, he had more receiving yards that year than Igbuka and Marvin Harrison Jr., and look, he went from about 17 touches per game over the last two seasons down to about 10 this year when Quinchon Judkins was added. In an interview, he mentioned that Ryan Day came to him when they added Judkins through the transfer portal, and he cited the Detroit Lions backfield in making this pitch to him, saying, hey, we can have the same complementary skill set and become the best backfield. If you do, give up a couple carries and add some explosives to your game. And that's exactly what happened. That's most of the NFL at this point too. You don't see many bell cows. Travion Henderson, I do not think will do that. He just comes in at just over 200 pounds. So he's gonna be in the committee in the NFL, just like what percentage of the pie is he gonna get? I think in comparison to Gibbs, I don't see like the rare explosiveness out in space. I don't see quite as much in between the tackles physicality with Travion Henderson, but I do think like how they would be utilized in terms of the touches that you'd be trying to get out of Travion Henderson, it would certainly look very similar to what you're getting from Jameer Gibbs. Yeah, there's a number of times where he creates his big runs and it's going against the grain of defensive backs. He's such like a free mover when in the open field, he's always looking to make those corners and those safeties, angling to attack him, miss in that area. I do think it's very easy to say, again, at what 202, 205 pounds, that, oh, I wish he was 10 pounds heavier so he could turn those three yard carries into five yard carries. But we have a ton of those types of runners in this class. And in every class, there's a handful of those that enters the NFL. I don't think that there's a Travion Henderson in every single class. Like to me, he's a difference maker. He alters the fabric of an NFL offense immediately. And I guess my question to you is, among all running backs, among all wide receivers you've watched so far, how many can you say that about in this draft class? Yeah, I think that's gonna be the reason why he's gonna end up going in the second round. I think for me, if I'm building out my team, that gets me a little bit nervous just because you can find some NFL running backs that play pass downs for super, super cheap in the draft. Now, I think that Travion has way more explosiveness than some of those types. So that's gonna be the pros and cons of this draft pick. To me, the comps, there's some James Cook to his element. I think that James Cook hasn't caught quite as many passes, but you see the explosiveness. Aaron Jones would be like the high-end comp who came and go with how many touches he would get in his career, maybe best as a utility guy, and then in a pinch later in the season, you can give him a big workload. I think the fallback would be Rashad White, who plays a lot more downs in the NFL than you would think because he's so good in pass protection. But I think Travion Henderson has a little more juice than Rashad White does. So you said it made you nervous to add him. To me, it's the exact opposite. I would feel amazing to add Travion Henderson to my team because of what he brings to the table. I know it's really easy to focus on something that gives, and I'll even bring up some here in a moment. The NFL is about creating explosives, and he brings explosives. And again, Rico Dowdell just signed for $3 million in a one-year contract, and he's the type that can create five yards, six yards on a two-yard run, typically. Like there just aren't these types to go around. I mean, I even think he can play three downs. I really do when I watched more and more and more because he definitely has some vision problems. And you saw that quite, I'm not gonna say you saw that quite often, but there were times when he ran into blockers, and I think it's the most of any running back that we've seen so far from like the tackle to tackle standpoint. But at the college level, he had the burst and explosiveness to make it right anyways. Like it was bumper cars, and then he turned into like an F1 car that just pulled away from everyone else. At the same time, there were far, far, far more opportunities, more carries, more touches, where I thought he showed good quality vision. And then there were plenty of moments and exposures where he finished through a defender. And even as a lead blocker near the goal line, he finished through a Penn State guy and put him directly on his back. He talked about that in an interview where he wanted to become more of a bruiser, more of a hammer on top of it. And that's never going to be his game, but at the very least, you do see smaller backs who never have like that element to them. And to me, at least he has that mentality of, oh, there's nowhere else to go. There's one-on-one for me, and I'm going to finish through him rather than finish on the ground. Yeah, I think that's where you and I probably are differencing in our opinions here. Like to me, I didn't see that much physicality as a rusher. You see it in other elements of his game. I think the mentality is there, but at the end of the day, when you are his size, and he's not like short and super stocky at 200 pounds, like he's just like a normal size, 200 pound guy. And at Ohio State, he only had 20 carries over his entire career on third and fourth downs with two or fewer yards to go. And on those, he only converted them for a first down 55% of the time. Like only getting 20 carries, like the short yardage carries does kind of limit him. He was always giving that to a different style running back. Judkins, who we have a video on, was that this last year. And then 29th percentile in total yards per game. Obviously, when you're at Ohio State, you're splitting up the backfield, but those are like the two cons to his profile. I do agree that unlike some of the other really tiny backs, I can see the vision of this turning into the Aaron Jones type. So I think that's kind of the upside comp that I'm chasing, but I would feel more comfortable like at the round two, three turn than where I think he's gonna go, which might be in the early parts of the second round. I can even see a team late in round one just loving his landing spot. Yeah, I mean, the comparison spectrum I put him on was Tony Pollard and Aaron Jones. And we just looked back last year across the league of running backs who had the most touches per game. Obvious, the likes of Saquon Barkley and Jonathan Taylor at the top at 23 a piece, and then you have Kyron Williams. But you can go down to Tony Pollard who was 10th on the list at 19 touches per game. Aaron Jones, 12th on the list with 18 touches per game. Chase Brown was 17.7. And we can go further and further down the list. I won't waste people's time. Now that comes with those players missing games. And we have seen Trevion Henderson miss games during the past. At least our moniker is if you touch the ball a lot, you're gonna miss games no matter if you're a wide receiver or a running back. His miss games, five with a broken foot in 2022. And then he missed three games in 2023, which he called a, I think, cheap shot to his ribs. This spectrum of player, I feel that you can work around, not necessarily even work around. You can have them be a three down player, not be perfect on top of it. But like you said, there are very few running backs unless we're talking about the top two, three, four on this list that have a backfield totally to themselves. And so now that we are entering the age of split backfields also with the running game being so paramount. And on top of that, explosive runs that anytime the ball touches this guy's hands, he can change the outcome of a contest being extremely valuable. Man, again, I'm like every single play caller that watches this guy and wants him on my team. Yeah, so how many touches, like just if you're gonna project this thing out, is he getting- 15 to 18 per game. Wow, I mean, if he's getting 18, that would be like a worthwhile. If you're gonna give him that many carries and touches just in general in round two, I think that would become where it's worthwhile. I think that if it's closer to the 12 to 15, that's to me where it's kind of- Like it might be 12 as first year, like Jameer Gibbs got, then go up to 15 to 18 as we go along their careers, like kind of grow into this a little bit, figure out what the NFL defensive game and offensive game is all about. And again, kind of evolve into that type of player. I'm not saying immediately once he comes in as a rookie, at the same time, you can see how he's gonna immediately impact an offense on top of this. And some stats that really matter, third in this class when it comes to yards after contact per attempt at 4.3 yards, 0.25 forcing this tackles per attempt, which is very solid. Just two drops over the last few years as a patch catcher, zero fumbles over the last two seasons as well. 22% of his carries went for 10 plus yards, then 14.4% went for 15 plus yards. And like, we're talking all about this explosiveness. What matters so much is that immediately he comes in and is one of the like best young pass protectors in the league. Like go and watch his game against Michigan State for everyone out there. They threw pressures at him from multiple spots and he handled it, almost all of it. And it was from the edge, from the interior, from delayed blitzes. Every single one, he knew his assignment. He was very confident in it. And he stayed in and mirror. Again, I wanna reiterate how rare that is for running back prospects, rare that is for a 205 ish pounder and rare it is for someone that is this explosive. Like the last time we talked about someone like this, it's kind of like Kyron Williams. And the difference in athlete between these two is not even close on the same stratosphere. Yeah, and I just wanna reiterate as well. Like it's not, his receiving production is not the basic forms of how players get the ball at running back. You are literally seeing big wheel routes, a big sluggo move down the field. You can run the option routes and stuff. So if there's a very, a coordinator that has like a big package of types of routes, he can handle all of that plus all of the assignments and pass protection. So I think we see him the same in that he is for sure gonna be one of the better pass game running backs in the NFL. Is he gonna be worth the top 40 pick, 50 pick? We'll see if he can translate that into the early downs to make it a full package back or if he's gonna be somewhere in the middle. Yeah, I mean, I've seen him termed a scat back by many. He had more, yeah. He had more of a finisher's mentality on necessary runs. I'm not saying he's gonna do that every single time. Like some of the 230 pound backs in this class do that. And 15 touches might not sound like a lot to people, but think about like how Bucky Irving changed the game for the box this year. He got 15 touches per game last year. James Cook, the exact same way for the Buffalo Bills. He averaged 15 touches. If he's in that realm during his first, second, third year, the way he creates these explosives, I'm all for it. I'm absolutely all for it. Even with some of the vision problems he showed out there on the field. All right, that does it. Longest one so far. So glad you tuned in.
