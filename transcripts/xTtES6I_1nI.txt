This is Arizona State running back Cam Scadaboo. Any talk of him being a fullback is completely disrespectful. This guy had 99th percentile fantasy points per game among all drafted running backs since 2005. He carried Arizona State, that is not an exaggeration, to the college football playoff. And to me, he's not just this hammer. Like, he's got 91st percentile BMI, he's a big, thick dude, but he's an excellent pass catcher, running real ass routes as well. So if his athleticism is good enough, which I believe it is, I think he can be an absolute workhorse in all phases. Yeah, there's a whole bunch to hit on in this profile. We will get to the athletic characteristics that he brings to the table, but also where I think people's perception of him might be a bit misguided. I do want to point out one run that kind of encapsulates who he is. It's one of the best one-yard runs you will ever see in your life against Cincinnati. Two nearly unblocked defenders at the line of scrimmage meet him five yards in the backfield. He stays on the edge of both immediately after taking the handoff, has enough speed to turn the corner, which again, I think is being undersold by him, and then finishes over another Bearcat at the goal line for a walk-in touchdown. Like you said, a lot of people just think he's a straight line hammer. I see more. I think somehow, some way, he has this blend of elegance, smoothness, he's a bit bendy, he has more lateral lean, but we all know that when the run is up and he meets a square defender in the hole, he will lower his shoulder and attack the edge to pick up an extra three, four, or five, if not just run over the dude. Yeah, my best trait, he's just the alpha of the field. You see it with the leg drive. I think his contact balance is really good. He fights for extra yards, and one thing he does really well is, since he is so dense and low to the ground, he actually uses his arms in really cool ways, not just for stiff arms, but to keep his balance up, and then he can churn his legs to fight for extra yards. He's built really stocky, but I'm with you. I thought that his lateral ability is being undersold a little bit, and to me, the biggest thing that's being undersold to him, his short area burst, I think is actually good, and we see that in the vertical jump, 39 1⁄2 inches, that puts him in the 89th percentile. I thought just if you're running a race to the first down marker to the goal line, I think he totally holds up and can win that race. Is he gonna rip off 60-yard touchdowns? I'm less optimistic about that, but most running backs don't do that. I think that the name of running back is, can you make the first guy miss or run through the field defender? I think he does that, and I think a lot of the times, he actually can run a little bit to the outside as well, so I was really fascinated by him. I don't think I would call him smooth. I would just call him the alpha, and that's a lot of what running back is. So let's put that athletic profile in perspective. He is 5'9 1⁄2 and 219 pounds. He just turned 23 years old. He ran a 4.6540 hand-timed at his pro day with a 1.5810-yard split. So many people out there just care about that straight line speed, and especially the long speed, and we'll touch on that in a moment, but I think that's also overlooking the athlete that he is, because as you said, he has amazing jumps, 89th percentile vert, 72nd percentile brawl jump. He did start his college career at Sacramento State. I believe it was the only Division I offer that he received, then transferred to Arizona State over the last two years. So let's put that 4.65 in perspective, because it's a major talking point. And again, James Conner ran a 4.65. Granted, that was at 233 pounds, or Mondre Stevenson ran a 4.64 at 231 pounds, and the comparison I kept coming back to was actually Dave Montgomery at 4.63 and 222 pounds, almost an identical size. You talked about the long speed. It shows up in some ways, but not in all the others. For example, he posted 45 runs this year of 10 plus yards, which is really freaking good, but only three of those ended in a touchdown, and two were versus the Utah Youths, which he just ran over them. So to me, he kind of lacks that final gear that we've talked about with some other running backs in this class, that as soon as they get parallel with the safeties or the corners, or don't get hawked from behind, I don't think he necessarily has that pull-away speed to then totally end drives and convert six-point plays on those. At the same time, though, I do want to mention, as you talked about his receiving game, he did have 13 receptions of 15 plus yards, and three of those ended in a touchdown of 33, 36, and 50 yards. So the dude is a weapon in the receiving game. Oh, absolutely. 99th percentile in receiving yards per game among drafted running backs, 99th percentile. We cannot just let that go by itself. That is insane production. There was a couple of double moves on the perimeter for big explosive plays. Yes, double moves on the perimeter for a 5'9", 220-pounder. He plays big, but he also has a little bit of finesse to his game. There's a lot of swing routes, lots of screens, but you do see some Texas routes. You talk about the double moves from the perimeter. I thought he had legit ball tracking, which is something I rarely write in my running back reports. So I think that's the fascination, is unlike some of the guys that we mentioned already with some comps, there's a chance that he catches 60, 70 passes in a season depending on the landing spot. So the production in both the run games with the touchdowns, the success rate, but also the receiving aspect makes him like a complete outlier level prospect. Now, I'm not expecting as many 30, 40, 50-yard plays in the NFL as he had at Arizona State. Like how I put it, if you give him a clean lane, he definitely has enough juice to get you 12 yards. If you force single contact at him near the line of scrimmage, he has the power to also get you 12 yards, but he does seem to have enough speed to get to the edge, to win the corner, which to me is very important. And I actually think he's maybe being underappreciated in the zone runs too. And it's not just these gap power runs between the tackles over and over. And I always bring this back to, you know, athleticism and the running back position. Because it's a skill position, so many people just believe you have to be a top-end athlete. And I love athletic testing. I think it's an awesome tool when it comes to evaluations, but I actually value it the least at the running back position. I mean, you've heard me say this before. I've said it with these other running back prospects, but you know, Josh Jacobs, Bucky Irving, James Conner, Kyron Williams, Dalvin Cook, Romandre Stevenson, Devante Freeman, Frank Gore, et cetera, all range from average to flat-out bad athletes. And it's because if we're talking about straight line speed, if it takes you multiple points to get started and go in a straight line, that's equal to someone who wastes no movement, their eyes and their feet are connected. You're efficient with your cuts with, again, that bend and to get upfield. And to me, there is like zero fat to his game with a bunch of that stuff. It makes him just as fast as a smaller player who might be more undersized, but also faster. Yeah, and most of the time, you're trying to win the race to 10 yards. You're very rarely winning the race to 40 yards with all that stuff. And I think the other big thing is he's a finisher, and there's something to that at this position where like you're getting everybody fired up on the sideline consistently. That's gotta mean something at this position. I think that he's reached that level where just finishing plays, really very few players are at this position. A couple of weakness points real quick for Cam Scadaville. It's not just the long speed. I thought his pass protection was hilariously awful. Better keep your head on the swivel because he's coming for you. Zero technique. He actually misses a lot of blocks. I'm not sure if his awareness is all there, but he's trying to find somebody. He might take out his own left tackles, kneecap and stuff. So that was a really big like bull in a China shop is kind of how I would describe it. So that has me a little bit worried for somebody that's as productive as a receiver. He's got to figure that out. He is 23 years old. I mentioned this on the Ashton Gente video. He also has had a major, major, major workloads. I think that'll be fine for his rookie contract, but just compared to that with how he plays, I do have some longevity issues with somebody like him, but maybe he's just so dense and he's got so much drive that it won't end up mattering. But those are a couple of just like the weaknesses to his profile. To reiterate that point on pass protection, he had a shockingly low number of pass per reps this year at just 38, according to PFF. And I think he legitimately watches Bill Goldberg WCW highlights before going into the arena because he's looking for a knockout blow every single time. There was one rep against BYU and a free blitzer. He tried to legit spear him. And he goes for that knockout blow over and over again. And that leads to him stopping his feet, lunging. He also cut low a lot for a guy that's five, nine and a half and 219 pounds. It's almost counterintuitive to how people again might perceive him and how he kind of breaks the mold and breaks the rules of what his body type is. I want to close with one quote though, from our Twitter buddy, Jetpack Galileo, where if you're so nervous about who he is as an athlete, if Kyron Williams and Bucky Irving can be small and slow and good, why can't Cameron Scadaboo be big and slow and good? You know? It's very similar types of runners in that system, I feel like. Yeah, a couple of comms that are in my notes, James Conner, Mark Ingram, Zach Moss, like you mentioned a couple of other great ones. Like these guys aren't super fast, but these guys can handle a huge workload as long as their body can maintain. And yeah, the production is, it's truly off the charts. Like a lot of the charts that we're putting on the screen here, it's like up into the right, by himself, forced missed tackles, it's yards after contact, but it's also just like the receiving yards, the amount of workload he's getting. And like that Arizona State team before the season was not supposed to go to the college football playoff, like not even close. The reason why they did is solely because of him. He almost beat the Texas team, which has a bunch of guys that are going to go in the first round. It is just Arizona State. And I think that has to mean something there. So one of my favorite players to watch, absolutely. I actually have like an early round three grade. Like I don't think that this is like some gimmick. Like I see a lot of the stuff that he does, like absolutely translating. Physicality in the NFL, like, yeah, that matters. My comparison, I'll again say it, is like Dave Montgomery with the very low end being Jay Ajayi, who had some awesome seasons in the NFL. I am saving the James Conner comparison for another prospect in this class. So a little hint for you out there to hit that subscribe button, watch our other prospect profiles. Yeah, just to finish out with some of those stats, 1.95 yards per route run is the second best in this class for a dude that's an absolute hammer, right? The second most forced missed tackles at 103 in the 2025 class. Third in missed tackles forced per attempt at 0.35. And then he had 4.09 yards after contact, which is top 10 in this class. So he's a fun one, man. Like if you want to install an identity on your team, and if he goes to a split backfield where he doesn't have to do all the grunt work all the time, and he can at least be ball carrier for you inside the 10, inside the low red zone, and then he's complimented, supplemented by a purely explosive back, I also think he'll shock people with the explosives that he generates too. The more you dig into this class, it makes it more and more difficult to rank these guys in the top 10, because while some have an overlap, some are wildly different, but so many of them are super talented. Yeah, it's gonna be hard to figure out exactly where in the top five I want to put them. There it is.
