# Work this way

- Focus: Modify only the code I specify; leave everything else untouched.
- Steps: Break large tasks into stages; pause after each for my approval.
- Planning: Before big changes, write a plan.md and await my confirmation.
- Tracking: Log completed work in progress.md and next steps in TODO.txt.
